This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates the common ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bug.java file shows the erroneous code, while the bugSolution.java file provides a corrected version.  The error occurs when the code attempts to access an array element using an index that is outside the valid range of indices for the array.  This is a frequent error in programming and understanding how to handle it is crucial for writing robust code. The solution involves adding a check to ensure the index is within the bounds of the array before attempting to access the element.
